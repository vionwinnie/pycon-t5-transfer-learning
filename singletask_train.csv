I have a bunch of notes on lined paper that I want to scan and put into GoodNotes. But the biggest requirement is that I need to add to the existing notes. 
In most cases I can’t add another page, because it won’t be inline with everything. So I need to make sure I can write outside of the PDF margins or add space. 
Since the PDF is going to be my main notes I don’t want it to end up being really small when I place it. 
Can GoodNotes do this? If not any recommendations?Rather than scanning as pdf -use the camera in GoodNotes.  Take a photo and add the image to a page.  You can then scale it to the size you want with space on the side and bottom.  Remember that you can zoom in if the text is not as big as you want it - this is how I do it.  You can also write all over the image and use the highlighter on the image Thanks for the help! The reason I thought about scanning is because I’d like to have that clean look. I worry if I use camera it will have shadows or the quality won’t be as good. 
Can I not do all those things you listed but with a pdf? Size it, write over imagine and highlight? Hi. Just tried it and the answer is no.  When you import a pdf it creates a GoodNotes page and you cannot scale it.  You can scan using good notes and if the scan is a different size to the page, I.e. smaller then you have the space around the scan, but again you cannot scale it. Hope this helps",Question

I’m most likely going to be buying an iPad for university (going into second year), and would use goodnotes. I’m just trying to figure out if 32 gb is enough, or if I’d need the 128. 

How much storage do your notes take up?

If you add a lot of pictures, it get‘s very full soon, not going to lie! 

But if you‘d sent them to your computer anyways, maybe have an own harddrive - 32gb should be enough as well :) Thank you!

When I search for a single number like 1 or 3 nothing comes up.  I searched for a word next to the number - and it does recognize it as a number.  i.e.

1 love - search for 1 doesn't find it.  Search for love and the 1 shows up converted in the search.  So it definitely finds and transcribes numbers.

So then I tried writing a 12 as neatly as possible - boom it shows up - so somehow a single number or letter search doesn't work.  I also tried searching for the letter ""a"" - and that turned up nothing but ""an"" showed a bunch.

So maybe try writing 01 02 and 03 - I did that and the search found those.  And TBH I was doing my date numbering using Art Deco style - which look look cool but I didn't think handwriting recognition would find it.  But It did as long as I searched and had 2 numbers.",Question

Every.  Fucking. Time.  The 5.2.2 update a few days later has not solved the problem.  I’ve reached out to GN and they suggest I uninstall and reinstall (I’ve done this a few times), or remove iPadOS beta from my device and run ios12, which I *really* don’t want to do since I use some of theiPadOS features.  I’ve resorted to using GN5 on my phone (not ideal) and the GN5 beta for Catalina on my MacBook Pro , but GN5 Catalina has a few bugs that make using it a bit of a challenge.  I’m not seeing any other users complaining about the crashing issue on any of the GN forums I’ve checked, so ,maybe it’s  just me?  This is really fucking with my productivity since I use GN for everything from managing daily tasks to annotating PDFs.  If anyone has had this problem and has discovered a workaround, I’d love to hear about it.Don't mean to sound like an asshole, but you installed beta software on your device and are complaining about bugs. You knew the risks. There have been issues with many apps throughout iOS 13's beta period. GN5 has crashed on iPadOS 13.1 beta since day one if I remember correctly, which is the reason I chose to not update and keep 13.0 beta until its full release. iOS 13 should release during or shortly after Apple's September event, which is next Tuesday. I suggest you just wait it out. I've had it with one set of notes that just crashed every time I tried to open it - no big deal for me and the nature of beta software.

What are the benefits of owning an iPad Pro?Accounting and Finance student here. Can’t speak for the iPad Pro since I’ve only got the Air but in terms of writing on PDFs that teachers give you, being able to tag and mark up various types of questions by topic it’s brilliant. I prefer it to noteability purely because of how you can organise it as I didn’t like the structure of noteability. 

In terms of entire textbooks I’ve never had the need to import a textbook and I’m on my final semester. Any textbook I’ve needed to reference I’ve just took pictures of the pages in Uni or at home. For questions and solutions I use screenshooting and annotating a lot - especially with exam style questions or professional body definitions and explanations etc where the original source matters and I don’t want to take away from the original format. 

In terms of iPads I’ve had no issues running anything on my iPad Air and it’s nice and light to carry about back when in person classes were a thing. yeah  you just need to make sure it's a PDF! But any textbook that has a ""print"" feature you can print those as a pdf and import into goodnotes. I'm using it for my two german classes and loving it. In my case (as a composer) I bought the Pro for the big screen. Having more space to fill in notes in between staff lines is crucial for me. However, if it’s just for note taking, I think you’re fine with the Air.

The extra size might be a thing if you’re going to take a lot of notes in split screen.

You could open 2 windows of GoodNotes and then run the two windows side by side. Kind of a pain as you'd have to scroll both windows.  

[Check out this GoodNotes support article on multiple windows on iPad.](https://support.goodnotes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001118635-Opening-GoodNotes-in-multiple-windows-on-iPadOS)

Have the same document open.  The windows scroll independently which is a pain if you are just reading through a PDF. 

You could also switch to Vertical scroll which would allow you to zoom out and see multiple pages.

I've been hearing a lot about GoodNotes and since I've finally upgraded to an iPad Pro where my Pencil works well, I was wondering if it's better for me to get the GN5 bundle (the one where I pay for GN4 and download GN5 for free) or go straight to paying for GN5?

I saw how buggy GN5 is, seeing how it's still in beta, and thought of opting out to GN4 in the meantime until the bugs are fixed.Probably a better option to go with Notability seeing as the issues still haven't been fixed months after the release... GN4 has its own issues that may or may not effect you. I’d just hard pass on the lot and look elsewhere. 

There’s no point getting used to the workflow of a deprecated piece of software (GN4) hoping that GN5 will become usable at some point. 

GN5 not in beta though, it’s released and people have paid for it. 

Notability, Note Shelf 2 are two reasonable alternatives to investigate. There are others but those are the ones I’d recommend.  I’m a long time GN4 user and didn’t have any problems with it. GN5 has its problems, probably released too early, but they are working hard to address them. 
GN beats Notability in the way notes are organised and the ease of creating new papers - I like notability for its ink and pens, but the key to note taking is being able to find what you previously wrote. 
My advice, and only mine, would be to go with GN4 and give them a month or so to resolve the bugs, they are close now",Question

I definitely find myself sacrificing productivity for concerns about aesthetics and fiddling around with minor layout/text size/whatever things, and it makes me wonder whether taking notes this way is actually worth the time I spend or not. How do you guys deal with this? Do you find with time you become quicker as you get used to setting out notes and finding a way that works for you? I've been using Goodnotes for a few months now, but not regularly (and prior to this I've never really taken notes before in my life lol) so I could just be needing time to find compromises and methods that work. 

Also, as a bit of a bonus q - how do you guys deal with not taking down too much unnecessary information as part of your notes? I find myself often copying almost entire pages/paragraphs from my textbook near word for word, rather than being able to effectively summarise information. If anyone has any links to guides on note taking I'd really appreciate them (not Cornell though :&lt; something about that style pisses me off even just thinking about it).

Hope you're all having a good day :)Aesthetic notes are pleasing to read later. I loved those notes too, but I think it they are the result of perfectionism. I make my notes only okay, with readable handwriting, some alignment of stuff/formulas/etc and some highlighting. That’s it. Rest is only our desire to make beautiful notes. If you’re wondering, I fill a Goodnotes standard paper in about 30 minutes. Would be 45 to 55 for A4. Don’t spend a lot of time decorating them. 
As for the copying, you don’t need to clone your textbook in a beautiful manner, the best way of taking notes is summarising. I don’t have any resources except for YouTube Videos by Ali Abdaal, Anas Nuur Ali, and KharmaMedic. 
Here’s a tip, in a language, you have some keywords and some grammar terms. Differentiating between them will help knowing what’s important and what’s not. Hi, hope you’re having a good day too! 

I use A4 size paper with the dark background, usually dotted or square template. 

I’ve been using GoodNotes for 3 year-ish. At the beginning, I took my notes very slowly because I tried to make it look pretty. But now, I went through pages pretty fast. 

What I did was simplifying the kind of notes i write. Instead of focusing on making it look pretty, I just wrote whatever quickly using 1 pen style, and highlighting / circling the important parts quickly. The organization of the notes is done when I’m going through them.

Basically, I’m treating it like a scrap paper that I can write anything on. 

Maybe this is something you want to consider? I took a lot of notes during class or with a recording going on (that I'll try not to pass if I can avoid it). This forced me to spend more time on writing stuff down rather than worry about the aesthetics. Especially, since I am going to have a bad handwriting anyway if I am writing fast.

Also using only 1-2 pen colour(s) while taking notes also helped because I can't really do much aesthetics while not changing pen style or colour. I would use s highlighter during revision to highlight important points.",Question

But it protects everything, less than half the price, decrease writing sound and gives a little friction to work with. For reference I got the pzoz tip cover white colour from aliexpress :P I think the matte screen protector is worth it. It makes it much easier to write on the screen and it basically eliminates the drag of my hand against the screen.

I end up drawing with highlighters, which is fun but not functional by any stretch of the imagination...Nvm found CollaNote on this subreddit - has many features I use in Goodnotes AND Apple Notes' pencil-like brush AAAND is free. I'll switch to that for a while there's an app which was recently released called collanote which is free and has a pretty damn good pencil Yup found it an hour after I posted this and became its beta tester.

tag classification,"Easy way to include outline actually ON for example second page of a document?So outline works. That’s great as long as you stay on your iPad. Opening your outlined pdf (editable) export gives a neat overview of the chapters you’ve set, also when reading in Apple Books. 
BUT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT ADDING YOUR OUTLINE EFFECTIVELY ON A PAGE. Did none of the devs really think of that or am I just missing something? 
Right now, I have to take a screenshot of the index in iBooks, return to my Goodnotes document, add the screenshot to page 2 or 3 to create an in-document table of contents... 

Seems crazy; is this the only way to do this?Yeah, that's pretty rough. Also, if trying to open the editable PDF on a Windows laptop, the pages tend to take a while to load due to being editable and (in Chrome PDF viewer) the bookmarks tend to be off by a page.

I've resorted to outlining my document as I write it out and then making a table of contents manually on the first page based on the outline. This allows me to export flattened but still know which page covers which concepts, etc.

Definitely takes a good three or four minutes for longer lecture notes (which can add up over time), but it's what works best with my academic workflow.",Question

Just go to the iPad settings app then tap iCloud and it should tell you.

You can also check if it's device storage by going to the settings app then general then storage. Is there a work around for this if I’m not trying to pay for additional iCloud storage? If you don't want to pay you can always just move old content from the iCloud to like a harddrive or USB storage, and delete anything you don't need on there. PDFs can be big but usually it's movies and audio files too. 

But getting iCloud honestly isn't too too bad it's like $1.50 per month (that's either Canadian or Australian dollars) for their cheapest option which I'm using. Just mentioning this as I really did not want to at first as I assumed it would be typical apple overpricing but it's surprisingly affordable.

Also, if you're seeing you've got a lot of space available on your harddrive, I think you just have to play with the iCloud settings to tell it to not automatically upload everything from certain files. I roughly recall doing it before and it not being impossible.",Question

2. What is wrong with it? is it the bundle? of the apps themselves? are the apps different from buying it separately? 
3. Some people say goodnotes 5 was really a down grade compared to goodnotes 4, is it true?
4. I also noticed in some posts here that when buying the bundle it still shows that you have to buy both?
5. will goodnotes add an audio recording option? like record audio while writing?1. No idea why the bundle is rated badly, but the bundle was created so that users of GN4 can upgrade to GN5 for free. You should just get the bundle because it will give you both versions. 

2. I think point 1. answers this too.

3. To me, definitely. I like the new interface and infinite scrolling, but one thing that I can never get over with is that they changed the inking behaviour. I used to love GN4 for their pen alone, even though they were missing some features. They changed the only thing I cared about. GN5 is also a battery hog compared to GN4.

This is not an issue on iPads because the iPadOS handels Ram differently. There, the least needed app is just removed from Ram completely when ram is needed (with no mercy). MacOS has more mercy which it honestly shouldn't have when there are a lot of apps that don't handle ram responsibly, like GoodNotes and Notability.Mommy!!! 🤤 Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you!You have the option for creating an schema for the notebook, if that's what you're asking for.

 In the top left corner, next to the arrow you'll see a button made of 4 squares (I'll call that button the ""Page View"", for future reference). Press it. Then click on the downwards arrow of any page and select ""add page to the schema"" (or something like that), it will ask you to put a name and you're done.

Alternatively, on the top right corner, on the menu that appears after pressing the 3 dots you can select ""add this page to the schema"" too. I can send you a vid if needed.

After this, in the Page View, you'll have 3 tabs on the top. Thumbnails/pages, Favs and **Schema** or whatever name it has in english. Thank you, that was actually perfect.

tag classification,"GoodNotes 5 Plam Rejection and Apple Pencil[removed]Exactly! I recently see so many passive-agressive posts on some social media sites - gladly, not on Reddit - implying that any other identity for the Vessels than non-binary is invalid and transphobic.  
(I wanted to make a post about this, would that be an insensitive thing to do during Pride Month? I understand that non-binary people are happy about representation and can get protective about this, but that doesn't imply that the former behaviour is okay, I even saw other enbies on Twitter saying this claim goes too far. Even Team Cherry admits to sometimes fall back to ""he"" unintentionally. They might indicate that they originally designed and mentally still perceive the Knights as rather leaning to the male spectrum, but their canonical genderlessness stands and they support non-binary interpretations nonetheless.)

But there are so many years and the recording feature is still not in test version. I'm just curious if it's just a technical problem or even a legal problem and GoodNotes developers do not tell us to keep our hopes up.

I do miss recordability, but it seems that goodnotes has increased quality with notetaking and more options compared to notability.

tag classification,"thinking about getting an ipad...... to take digital notes for school. i start university this fall, so I have enough time to save for the iPad Air. My only question is whether you feel that it’s worth it to take digital notes. I for one love how the layout of digital notes look and the convenience of it all.

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!I switched to digital notes during my second year of college and as such have six semesters and three years of experience with them, and I can say I GREATLY prefer them over physical notes.  The ability to search for things in-text but still have the option to draw diagrams makes them very useful.  I also like them for future reference, because I have all of the notebooks from my last three years in college and none of them from my first two, and I can access them both on my iPad and any other device which can access Google Drive. That certainly sounds convenient. Knowing me, I’m Prly gonna end up buying the iPad, I just wanna hear stories from other people about this I love it! It takes some time to getting used to, the writing feeling especially, but it's very practical. You can access your notes from literally anywhere if you Auto synch them as a pdf (as well with/instead of via iCloud, I do both) so if you just want to look something up but don't have your iPad with you, your notes are on your Cloud. It also saves so much paper. My brother, who is also doing online school but doesn't take notes digitally, has to print out sooo much and I can just import it and write on the iPad. Also being able to search your notes is so practical

I really like it and spend so much time on my iPad I'd say it's a must have for me",Question
tag classification,"GoodNotes Writing &amp; Erasing BuggyI've been using GoodNotes 5 for a couple of months now and have been noticing some strange artifacts when writing and erasing.

Whenever I'm zoomed in and writing small letters or mathematical symbols, it looks like GoodNotes sometimes attempts to ""smooth out"" my writing causing half of the mark I just made to curl up or disappear.

Example:  [https://i.imgur.com/boG2Biq.gif](https://i.imgur.com/boG2Biq.gif)  (notice how the bottom of the + sign gets abruptly cut off after writing it)

I just got my iPad, and I wanted to download a note taking app. 
The two main options are Goodnotes and Notability. 

I’m intrigued much more by Goodnotes, but there is the audio recording feature of Notability which would be incredibly useful for classes (I’m attending university). 

Can anyone share their experience regarding this? What app do you use? 
How is your experience with Goodnotes?

Thank you!I use good notes 5 on my iPad. I also have notability, but I use good notes more because I'm used to it and haven't had the time to try out notability yet. I found good notes to be more user friendly and easier to master. I do plan on learning how to master both when this semester is over. I love the dual screen/slide over feature when it comes to copying and pasting pictures into my notes. Good notes has been a good send to be so far when it comes to note taking. Good luck ;) Notability is more reliable and functional. GoodNotes is rather more pretty and organized.

**in my opinion -** the shapes feature in GN is terrible, and probably the only reason that made me take my math notes in Notability. Why? 

1. You cant reshape after forming a shape
2. if you want an *even* triangle and you're not precise - good luck with that.
3. that actually extra step to activate shapes mode rather than just holding the pencil and waiting for something to form is annoying.

Other than that and the auto backup feature which will be added soon, GN is great.

its clean &amp; neat. the highlighter is a delight, the pencil styles, papers are just a better experience in GN. I use Goodnotes on my iPad for lectures. I also have it on my MacBook!
Goodnotes has been so amazing. Since it’s on your iPad you’re much more motivated to take notes and to study. I bought my iPad shortly before midterms and I used Goodnotes to study for them. I’ve never had such good grades in university! Goodnotes is my personal favourite, I like the interface much more and the easiness of it. Such an amazing tool!

tag classification,"Do you take notes on goodnotes while in class, or do you first take notes on paper, and then make an improved note on goodnotes later on?I'm still waiting for my apple pencil to arrive, so I can't yet say, but I feel like I'd have a lot of trouble writing quickly and/or legible on goodnotes (or any app) while being actively in class.

I feel like I'd be considerably faster writing on paper first, and then putting everything onto goodnotes.

The pro in that would also be that I'd basically read and write everything I've written down once again and basically study at the same time.

On the other hand, it might be a bit of a time waster if I do so, instead of ditching pen/paper altogether, which was originally my plan.

I'd like to hear how you use goodnotes and maybe you might also have a tip or two for someone who is entirely new to writing on a tablet.

Thank you!You can also just have a separate notebook in goodnotes for notes during class and use the good notes app on a secondary device (Mac? If you have one) to read notes and retake them in better format when reviewing. That's a great idea! I guess I was just worrying that due to needing to adjust to writing on a tablet I'd be too slow to keep up in class with my usual note taking.

I'll get my pen tomorrow, so I can't really judge it yet. I tried writing with my finger, and I can already tell that the zoom tool will be a bit of an hassle for me. 

But on the other hand, I clearly did not have the proper tool to work with. You can write on paper first, then copy into good notes. This also helps with reviewing the material.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder will they offer a bundle price?I don’t know if they will offer something like that in the future.
But the problem at the moment is, that Catalyst Apps that got submitted to Apple using a version of Xcode before 11.4 had there own bundle ID. And universal purchase is only available for apps using the same IDs. Therefore GoodNotes can’t offer a universal purchase jet. 

And in ATP they sad that switching the bundle ID isn’t all that simple.


https://developer.apple.com/support/universal-purchase/

But to be honest... I am not a developer myself so I don’t understand all the fine details behind those information myself 😅 Oh so maybe they have to make a new app with that in mind.

In other words Good Notes 6 would be able to do it, if there is to be one. The apps aren’t that expensive. I get why we want them to bundle them. But the angry tone of “ignore” seems uncalled for.

It easily takes 2-3 GB of ram on my 8GB M1 MacBook Air. (I know the performance is trash on Intel Macs as well but it is actually usable on Apple silicon) 

This is not an issue on iPads because the iPadOS handels Ram differently. There, the least needed app is just removed from Ram completely when ram is needed (with no mercy). MacOS has more mercy which it honestly shouldn't have when there are a lot of apps that don't handle ram responsibly, like GoodNotes and Notability.Mommy!!! 🤤 Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it.

tag classification,"Ram mangement is trash!The ram management of the GoodNotes Mac App is trash, it never releases any of the Ram it takes if you don't quit the application manually, even if you close taps or document. It easily takes 2-3 GB of ram on my 8GB M1 MacBook Air. (I know the performance is trash on Intel Macs as well but it is actually usable on Apple silicon) 

This is not an issue on iPads because the iPadOS handels Ram differently. There, the least needed app is just removed from Ram completely when ram is needed (with no mercy). MacOS has more mercy which it honestly shouldn't have when there are a lot of apps that don't handle ram responsibly, like GoodNotes and Notability.Mommy!!! 🤤 Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

tag classification,"ISO template in light modeThat’s a great way to look at it. Thanks! Arkadaşım, hiçbir kadın vajinası olup östorojen salgıladığı için öldürülmüyor. Öldürülmelerinin sebebi yetiştikleri kültüre veya partnerlerinin veya ailelerinin kültürüne göre onları rezil ediceklerini düşündükleri şeyler yapmaları ya da kız arkadaşlarının/eşlerinin  ayrılmasını kendine yediremeyecek kadar şerefsiz olması. Hedefi doğru belirlemiyorsunuz feministler olarak ben feminizm hakkında bir sürü insanın görüşüne danıştım ve bir sürü kaynağa da baktım. Yani yazacak çok şeyim var. Hedefi doğru belirlememe konusuna geliyorum, şimdi 10 çocuk düşün hepsi şişman ve hepsinde zeka geriliği var. Bu çocukları bir teste soktuk ve hepsi başarısız oldu. Başarısızlıklarının sebebi olarak şişman olmalarını gösterirsem tam da senin yaptığın şey olur. Oysaki başarısızlıklarının sebebi zeka geriliği olması. Şimdi konumuza dönelim 10 erkek düşün, bunların hepsi eşlerini veya bir aile üyesini kültürüne uymadığı için öldürmüş kişiler olsun. Bunların kötü olan özelliği erkek olmaları mı yoksa bok gibi kültürlerde yetişmiş ve bunu benimsemiş olmaları mı? Türkiyede feminist olduğunu iddia edenlerin de yarısı erkek düşmanı. Ben senden daha az eğitimli 100 kişiyle tartışmış olsam bunlardan 50 tanesi feminist gibi geçinen erkek düşmanları. Tarihte onlara eziyeti ben çektirmedim onlara ama benim gibi insanlardan intikam almaya çalışıyorlar gibi oluyor. oh so is there a reason you couldn't have just answered the question without being rude about it? ""YoU kNow ThAt PLENTY oF fAnS.."" if I knew that, would I have asked this? lmao did I offend you by not knowing every detail? 

also, your math is pretty off. Hannah is 3 when they're captured? 10 where we are now? that's 7 years... June's journey is 2 years + 2 years = 4 years , plus 8 months?

I was getting a bit frustrated with having to use the Cornell page with the summary, so I've created an extended version which includes:

\- First Page with space for header and no summary

\- Notes Page with space for notes only

\- Summary Page which includes a slightly extended space for the summary

It's just an edit of the existing Goodnotes template, so can be used seamlessly with it.

What i do is on procreate, i activate drawing guide snd switch to grid, then set the grid size to 2.5mm more or less (can't add a value with numbers you just slide the bar) and i draw lines over that grid.

Will this allow me to print my notes without causing any issues?You would have to check if your printer is inkjet or laserjet printer first. AFAIK inkjet printer cannot print white therefore white part would print nothing. Also normal colours would be also look dim on your paper. 

Then you print your paper with a white toner, but it doesn’t seem you can print in various colours. A bit late to this thread but you can switch the colour of the paper before printing if you don’t mind white on paper? No, you’d need an offset printer for that.

I'm planning on selling planners and notebooks in the future. But as practice, I created these two for free.

Please let me know what you think about the notebooks! Also, what templates are most useful to you? Are there specific planner spreads that you need but rarely find? I might make more stuff to give away so I'd really love your opinion! Clean and simple, thank you",Templates
tag classification,"ISO template in light modeThat’s a great way to look at it. Thanks! Arkadaşım, hiçbir kadın vajinası olup östorojen salgıladığı için öldürülmüyor. Öldürülmelerinin sebebi yetiştikleri kültüre veya partnerlerinin veya ailelerinin kültürüne göre onları rezil ediceklerini düşündükleri şeyler yapmaları ya da kız arkadaşlarının/eşlerinin  ayrılmasını kendine yediremeyecek kadar şerefsiz olması. Hedefi doğru belirlemiyorsunuz feministler olarak ben feminizm hakkında bir sürü insanın görüşüne danıştım ve bir sürü kaynağa da baktım. Yani yazacak çok şeyim var. Hedefi doğru belirlememe konusuna geliyorum, şimdi 10 çocuk düşün hepsi şişman ve hepsinde zeka geriliği var. Bu çocukları bir teste soktuk ve hepsi başarısız oldu. Başarısızlıklarının sebebi olarak şişman olmalarını gösterirsem tam da senin yaptığın şey olur. Oysaki başarısızlıklarının sebebi zeka geriliği olması. Şimdi konumuza dönelim 10 erkek düşün, bunların hepsi eşlerini veya bir aile üyesini kültürüne uymadığı için öldürmüş kişiler olsun. Bunların kötü olan özelliği erkek olmaları mı yoksa bok gibi kültürlerde yetişmiş ve bunu benimsemiş olmaları mı? Türkiyede feminist olduğunu iddia edenlerin de yarısı erkek düşmanı. Ben senden daha az eğitimli 100 kişiyle tartışmış olsam bunlardan 50 tanesi feminist gibi geçinen erkek düşmanları. Tarihte onlara eziyeti ben çektirmedim onlara ama benim gibi insanlardan intikam almaya çalışıyorlar gibi oluyor. oh so is there a reason you couldn't have just answered the question without being rude about it? ""YoU kNow ThAt PLENTY oF fAnS.."" if I knew that, would I have asked this? lmao did I offend you by not knowing every detail? 

also, your math is pretty off. Hannah is 3 when they're captured? 10 where we are now? that's 7 years... June's journey is 2 years + 2 years = 4 years , plus 8 months?

so.. 4 years and 8 months don't exactly close the gap. where does it ever say Hannah's age canonically?",Templates

tag classification,"Free Cornell Expanded Templates (White)Hey,

I was getting a bit frustrated with having to use the Cornell page with the summary, so I've created an extended version which includes:

\- First Page with space for header and no summary

\- Notes Page with space for notes only

\- Summary Page which includes a slightly extended space for the summary

It's just an edit of the existing Goodnotes template, so can be used seamlessly with it.

Link in comments :)These templates are so amazing and aesthetically pleasing! They're the first i see of this kind. They look modern af and i love them. Is it possible though that you could make one just like that but in A4 size? And also with smaller grid, 2.5mm. I have really small handwriting and I like many things to fit in one page. I think I'll post some of my very small gridded templates for the tiny handwriting people here as well 😂 If you have the super small gridded templates, I may ask you to forward them and leave them in the drive folder I created. I’m still trying to see how sizing will work but keynote is so finnicky 😭 Wait... People do them with keynote...? 


I feel so stupid right now. I do them on procreate omg there WAS an easier way all along. Frick. Well idk how that will work but I'll try. For a quicker way you can check my profile, i uploaded them earlier today in drive as well so you can see them there. Maybe they'll be useful for you too?

[here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1-9OY9hcUuD9LAN0dbc_odgetIqWskdaB) !!!! It's the link lol. Check them out if you want. What i do is on procreate, i activate drawing guide snd switch to grid, then set the grid size to 2.5mm more or less (can't add a value with numbers you just slide the bar) and i draw lines over that grid. Just a couple of them and then i copy and paste layers over and over again until it's done.",Templates

I’m still relatively new to the entire realm of the abilities of GoodNotes 5, but I’m an organic chemistry student and I would love to have a hexagon template for notes BUT I take my notes on black paper for the looks :/  Anyone have a black hexagon template they love in the normal portrait format? Also, if you have cute covers, I’d like some too. Thanks!!You could probably just use the dotted dark paper for that, I'm sure it would work out ok. You could always draw up a hexagon and keep it on a beginning index page, then copy and paste it whenever you need it.

tag classification,"If I buy black paper, will I be able to print my notes that are written on the black paper template?I prefer to use the black paper template as it’s easy on my eyes. The problem is that I need to be able to print my notes once I’m done. I found some black paper on amazon that works in a printer. Will this allow me to print my notes without causing any issues?You would have to check if your printer is inkjet or laserjet printer first. AFAIK inkjet printer cannot print white therefore white part would print nothing. Also normal colours would be also look dim on your paper. 

Then you print your paper with a white toner, but it doesn’t seem you can print in various colours. A bit late to this thread but you can switch the colour of the paper before printing if you don’t mind white on paper? No, you’d need an offset printer for that.
