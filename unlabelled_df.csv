agpzxb,What happened to the pen (Goodnotes 5)?,"I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?

I’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm).

Do I just have to start from scratch?I read that Goodnotes 5 and Goodnotes 4 are two different file types.

The pen feature is what upsets me the most, my handwriting looks disgusting now :(
Even though there are three pen “options,” they are all very laggy and make me feel as though I’m writing on a very old iPad. It is also a lot laggier in terms of scrolling, if I want to go through pages fast, they have to load. Goodnotes 4 didn’t do this. I really regret upgrading and I would give anything to go back. I suggest not transferring everything over and playing around, since the upgrade is free. "

bn8vce,Thoughts so far about GoodNotes 5,"Over the last few years I have jumped between GoodNotes, NoteShelf and real note books. Until now. I think this new version of GoodNotes, especially when the new version rolls out for the Mac, is just about spot on.

The writing isn’t quite as smooth as one or two other apps I have used on the iPad Pro but it’s acceptable. The feature set is getting better all the time and having the tabs at the top combined with a quick drop down list and a full document library view, it has so many excellent user friendly features.

So why not 5 stars in the Apple App Store?

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

So, for now, it’s a 4. Well, maybe a 4.5 really but that’s not an option in the App Store, unfortunately. 😀

e2m2ao,Some suggestions and improvements for Goodnotes 5,"Hi there

I have had GN5 installed on my iPad for a while now, and have come across some things that could be improved

1) The app seems kind of slow and laggy when scrolling through documents, especially if there is a fair bit written on a page

2) Writing occasionally disappears and then reappears

3) The colour code doesn't show the one of the colour currently selected. It always shows FFEEFF

4) Squared paper isn't sized how it should be compared to actual paper. On real paper you have squares that are 5mm wide and tall. The closest I have seen is the ""squared paper"" template, with 5,75mm intervals

5) Pen sizes in GN4 and GN5 use different systems. A ""1"" in GN4 is approximately a ""0,2mm"" in GN5, while a text marker ""10"" in GN4 is a ""2mm"" in GN5. Am i correct in assuming a 1=0.2 ratio?

I would be happy if someone were to look at these things and appreciate any response. Thank you.",,"['Is it still not possible to drag selected text to another side in the same document? If not then that should be pretty high on the to-do list. \n\nNow I have to copy/paste every time, it works but feels so unnecessary for an app like this.', ""I honestly haven't tried it that way and have always copy pasted if necessary.\n\nI think GN5 can be quite an improvement to GN4, but for now I will continue to use GN4"", 'I want URLs for docs, folders, pages and bookmarks.', 'One thing I can’t stand about Good Notes (and every other note taking app except for Apple Notes) is that there isn’t an option for a pencil that fully functions like an actual pencil. Good Notes doesn’t even have a pencil, and Notability has one but it doesn’t act much like a pencil but more like the ball point pen in Good Notes. I like the pencil to be pressure sensitive (I mean really really pressure sensitive), and I like it to look and shade like a real pencil. I don’t think that will EVER happen.\n\nIt annoys me, because I like certain things about each of the note taking apps, and I wish they’d make an app with all of it combined into one. I’ll start to think that I really really like a note taking app, and then one little thing will throw me so off that it disgusts me. Lol. I guess the cons outweigh the pros is what I’m trying to say, and it is very bothersome. I believe there are a lot of issues with copyright, and so that’s why they don’t all have the same features.\n\nI really like Apple Notes, but when I go to put my palm on the screen it goes crazy, highlights everything I’ve written, and if I’m not careful I’ll accidentally hit delete. You can undo it now, but think about how horrific it was when you couldn’t retrieve all of the notes that just took you hours to write!!!!!\n\nGood Notes feels very basic to me. I’m not sure why, but it’s just like their tools are very basic. There is pressure sensitivity on the pens, but its finicky. It only want’s to do a basic stroke instead of a real time pressure sensitive one (if you know what I mean). The shape section is so annoying to me too. I can’t actually insert a shape from a drop down menu (if I can I haven’t seen how to yet), and I think it’s kind of strange that you have to draw the shape. It takes a million tries to get it perfect and the way you want it to be. You can’t resize it after it’s done. Then stuff with files, drag and drop, etc.There are so many little things that nag at me, but that’s a few of them.\n\nEventually I get so mad I switch to another note taking app. I’ll use that one for a while, get mad at all of the issues with that one and switch to another one, and repeat. It’s an annoying dance I’ve been doing for a while.', ""I use GN5 on a 2019 iPad Pro. I've used it a lot for handwritten notes: several hundred hours.\n\n1. I've never seen this -- could be because of the iPad I'm using. I've noticed lag on my iPad mini 4 occasionally, but... I've not seen what you're talking about, more that sometimes the screen will be blank for a bit before rendering. But that is an older iPad.\n2. I have never seen this. I've handwritten more than a thousand pages. What model iPad are you using? I think that might be the difference.\n3. I've never seen this, Trying it now I can't get that to happen.\n4. Goodnotes is a little frustrating in this way. It \\*always\\* scales the paper to fit in on the screen so you're basically never seeing the paper at 100% zoom. It is always larger or smaller than 100%. The only way around this is to make your own templates that are carefully measured to exactly match the editable screen size on your device. I've done this for the iPad 11 Pro with the Graphics app. It's not that hard to to do but it isn't easy. I agree that this is frustrating. At the very least they should put a 100% zoom control somewhere so that you can get things properly sized regardless of paper size.\n5. I don't understand what you are saying, but I suspect that you're seeing something similar to #4 but regarding pen diameter. The pen diameter is dependent on how zoomed the current document is. A 2mm pen will only appear to be 2mm if the doc is at 100% zoom, which is problematic (see #4.) This too can be fixed by making your own templates and always using them: you will have consistent pen width. Otherwise as you switch between different page sizes the pen will seem thicker and finer, which is confusing.\n\nIn the future it would be very helpful for you to post you iPad model and what version of iOS you are running when asking this kind of thing. Cheers."", ""Once I figured out that Goodnotes wants the template that you're writing on to be \\*exactly\\* the size of the editable area of the screen and made me own templates it has been pretty remarkable. The pressure sensitivity and line width are zoom-dependent, so the pen will have less sensitivity and a finer line on a page that is larger than your screen and is therefore zoomed down and will be fatter and much more pressure sensitive on a page size that is smaller than the screen and zoomed in. It is confusing and annoying.\n\nBut I do wish that GN had the Apple Notes pen/pencil tools and could make links to documents and pages that I could use in other apps to go right to a spot in a specific document.\n\nI would use Apple Notes if it had a good PDF annotation function. I'm hopeful that they will add it."", 'Omg, I didn’t know that!  \nI wish they’d make links too.\n\nAbout Apple Notes and PDF annotation, OMG! That’s one reason that I bought Good Notes. I can not stand that you have to “mark up” a PDF to write on it. I hate it, and it’s so hard to do in Apple Notes because you have to scroll with two fingers to scroll down the PDF. It goes all crazy and out of whack, and it makes pencil marks with my fingers and does all kinds of stuff that I don’t want it to do. There is a lag when I mark up a PDF, and I’ll draw (for example) a circle, and it lags horribly. It will put the circle in the wrong place, and once I lift my pen it will jump to where I was originally trying to draw it.\n\nThere are so many ##little## things that all of these note taking apps need to work out, lol. It’s killing me.', ""1) I am using a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with everything updated to the current version, so I shouldn't have any issues regarding performance either. The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \n\n2) I will try to recreate that. \n\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF\n\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\n\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals."", ""The CPU on 2019 Pros is &gt;= 2x the CPU on the 10.5, which may be a factor. Have you tried to scroll the same docs on the built in PDF viewer to see if performance is similar? I can get something like what you're saying to only occasionally happen on an iPad that has 1/4 the CPU of the 10.5. Maybe it is a memory issue?\n\n3. I can reproduce -- you should report this as a bug! Good catch.\n\n4. Are you using the non-pressure sensitive pen? If you are and you set it to 5mm it should be 5mm no matter what zoom you are at. It sounds like you might enjoy creating your own templates. The Autodesk Graphic application makes this very easy to do."", ""I'd like the ability to hide the top-level navigation bar (above the tool bar). I'd prefer to have the screen real-estate back and pull the top-level bar down when I need it; seems a bit distracting.

They needed to get it out so they could support those, and also to sell enough copies to support future development. Since then, they have prioritized feature parity with GN4 to support longtime GN users who use all of the features that had to be removed in the transition. For what it’s worth, Apple did the same thing several years ago with the iWork suite, and it took _years_ to get all the features back. And it’s only in the last couple major releases that they have added significant new features.

The highest paid officer WAS patrol and he made $414,543.06 (in 2019). It\'s not a dishonest argument and it is all publicly available data. The fact that this was even possible and that there isn\'t a system in place to prevent this is unacceptable. Do you honestly think otherwise? I hope you never complain about taxes ;)  The Seattle Times said ""For example, the median for officers who worked at least 1,000 hours was $167,000."" The avg working year is 2000 hours, so that means there are a lot of officers who make over $167k with full benefits and taxpayer backed pensions. A Forbes report from last year states that the avg US salary for a police officer is $67,600. So Seattle officers, on AVERAGE, are paid $100,000 dollars more per year. I openly acknowledge there are additional considerations such as cost of living but there is no angle in which someone can argue in good faith that these officers are not well compensated. They should be well compensated but within reason and competitively.\n\nNow, my opinion is that the officers are leaving because they don\'t feel respected or appreciated. They are here to serve the community and right now that community is critical of them. Instead of taking stock of what truths may exist and how to bridge that gap, there has been some outright rejection of service to the community. It\'s basically a threat, accept us as we are no matter what we do or we may just stand by and let your community deteriorate. If a group has the power to legally take a life on behalf of the community, that community should absolutely hold that group to a very high standard. That is why they do deserve to be paid well. Same as why we hold medical professionals to a higher standard. When a job includes having people\'s lives in your hands it is very important that they get it right, every single time.\n\nAs for the de-fund police argument, it\'s a slogan, it\'s meant to be provocative. If calm normal community conversation provided the solutions people were seeking, that slogan may not have been so prevalent. My point stands that in the light of day, the average person wants more focus on mental health resources being the first responders (in applicable scenarios) to manage the response in a different way. If funding is the reason we can\'t have it, then a natural place to make adjustments is from what it would be replacing. That slogan was meant to force a conversation and it did. Sadly real change can\'t happen without some friction and forced uncomfortable conversations.\n\nThe same folks arguing all protesters are rioters are often the ones saying one bad apple doesn\'t spoil the whole bunch when it comes to police. I agree with that. But what we have seen again and again (nationally) is the blue wall and that police will back those bad apples to the bitter end. The bad apples aren\'t even fired in most cases, let alone held accountable to their community. That\'s a choice and if they choose to stand together then they should expect to fall together in the eyes of the community. The discomfort they feel is meant to inspire them to adjust that mentality, not abandon their responsibilities in retaliation. Neither plan has worked and no one is happy so maybe it makes sense to reset the table and people on both sides to start to show up with solutions instead of knee-jerk defensiveness and raw hostility.

I remember liking the song but I didn't know the group name. Then it played breathless, confession, baby and then crazy sexy cool. I found out their name through csc but I didn't know all the mvs I had watched were from the same group. It continued and played always you afterwards. My parents were talking about how handsome they were lol.  I was planning on googling astro after I got home (I didn't have data at the time) but I went home really late that day and forgot the name.\n\n My mum was watching koms and it happened to be sanha's episode. Once again, my parents talked about how good his voice was. I thought it was nice and relaxing but I wasn't interested in kpop at the time so I wasn't paying much attention to the show. After sanha introduced himself as part of astro, I got hit with deja vu. I couldn't remember where I heard that name before so I dropped it. \n\nOne day my mum was looking through dramas to watch but got distracted with something so she left the TV on the drama selecting screen. Idk how else to phrase that lol. I saw my id is gangnam beauty and saw eunwoo on the front. He looked so familiar to me but I still didn't remember where I saw him. Once again, I dropped it.\n\nI was starting to get interested in kpop in 2019. Not enough to stan any groups. Just to listen to a couple title tracks and watch a couple kpop related videos. I watched a compilation of mvs. Still don't remember what the title was but I skipped through the video and ended up watching a part of all night. It was the choreography scene and I only watched a tiny bit of it. Saw the name astro, thought it looked familiar but once again, I didn't bother looking into it.\n\nSaw Rocky's mask inspired dance in my recommended for days. Finally clicked on it and watched a bit of it. Wasn't into watching dancing at the time but he somehow managed to make me watch it. Afterwards, I slowly started watching dance videos. Rocky's magic honestly.\n\nWas watching some kpop video. Honestly don't remember what I was about when I read a comment that said astro's eunwoo was friends with bts. Also read about that in some article.\n\nThen I stumbled across the poster for true beauty's drama. I was a webtoon reader and my favourite character was suho. I saw the poster and immediately thought he looked familiar but I still didn't know where I had seen him. I wasn't into kdramas at the time so I didn't bother watching it. \n\nThen I found a true beauty interview in my recommended while I was using YouTube. I watched it because I was curious and they had a question on astro. Found it familiar again and this time, I finally gave in and looked them up. Watched the all night performance video thinking it was the mv. I'm stupid I know. Then I watched their reaction to it and absolutely fell for the chaos. Also realised I didn't watch the mv. So I watched the mv, loved the aesthetics. Watched their pool party video then found a link to the cicada video in the comment section. Subscribed to their YouTube channel immediately and watched the videos YouTube would recommend to me. \n\nI watched all their mvs and wondered why most of their songs/mvs were so familiar. Then I made the connection one day. Don't know why it took me so long honestly. The more I got into them, the more I realised I missed so many chances to become an aroha earlier.

f96ddj,Apple pencil switching issues,"My setup: iPad Pro 12.9” w/ Apple Pencil 2nd Generation

Does anyone have issues when they double tap their Apple Pencil to switch between the pen and the eraser in GN5 and it lags?

Example: You are writing something with the pen, you double tap the apple pencil to select the eraser. When you go to erase, the pen is still selected so you end up writing instead of erasing. When you lift the pencil, GN5 correctly selects the eraser and you can erase like normal.

Does anyone have issues when they double tap their Apple Pencil to switch between the pen and the eraser in GN5 and it lags?

Example: You are writing something with the pen, you double tap the apple pencil to select the eraser. When you go to erase, the pen is still selected so you end up writing instead of erasing. When you lift the pencil, GN5 correctly selects the eraser and you can erase like normal.

fsm63y,Goodnotes 5 is falling behind Noteshelf 2 on a crucial feature.,"I love Goodnotes 5. I think it’s powerful and very good in giving people the ability to organize notes and offering the templates people can use in their everyday needs. But there is one small feature that a rival note taking app has that I hope the developer for Goodnotes looks at seriously for improvement. Noteshelf 2 is another handwriting app which in my opinion is quietly gaining on the big 2 - Goodnotes and Notability especially because it’s introduced a handy little feature people are ignoring  - giving people the ability to adjust the line spacing while writing handwritten notes.

You might smirk and sneer at this but if you are using blank paper templates with no lines when jotting down notes - you wouldn’t laugh when looking back on your own writing and seeing your handwritten notes veering off wildly downward or upwards slanted in such a way you might lose track of your own train of thought. Well, Noteshelf 2 has Goodnotes by the shorthairs on this one because the developer was clever enough to foresee this issue and introduced the line adjustment feature built into its zoom box writing utility. Noteshelf 2 lets you see the line you’re writing on in the zoom box so wherever you’re actually writing on the page you simply write your sentence on the given line in the zoom box. This allows you to always write your notes in a straight line even on blank paper with no lines. Not only that but Noteshelf 2 lets the user adjust the spacing of the line so this way you can squeeze the notes you write onto smaller surface areas when dropping down to the next line. 

Goodnotes only gives the user a simple zoom box magnification mode letting you write in the box. But this doesn’t prevent you from veering off course if you write on unlined paper. This is the one area I hope the developer of Goodnotes looks into and copies Noteshelf 2’s clever feature to make it possible for people to write sentences in straight lines on unlined blank paper. Just my two cents.",,"[""Agree.  You know, I've never understood why folks only ask about Goodnotes/Notability when Noteshelf 2 is on par and in some ways superior to both.

As the son of a judge, I grew up with deep respect for the judicial process and the importance of a judge’s ability to make impartial fact-based rulings, but the fact that this judge compared the AR-15 – a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield – to a Swiss Army Knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon. We’re not backing down from this fight, and we’ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives.”\n\nCalifornia has led the nation in passing gun safety laws, having pioneered statewide protections approved by voters in Proposition 63 to ban possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks to keep ammunition out of the hands of dangerous people. Since assuming office, Governor Newsom has signed multiple bills aimed at reducing gun violence, including strengthening gun violence restraining orders and regulating the sale of firearms and ammunition. Governor Newsom also worked with the Legislature to accelerate the regulation of ‘ghost guns’ to crack down on the use of untraceable firearms by criminals.

Also, if you have a large enough phone, maybe you can buy a stylus for it? It'll make using it more fun than writing with your fingers. The interface is also pretty similar, so if you ever get a new iPad that's compatible with goodnotes, it'll be a cakewalk :) When you say their layout, do you mean their GoodNotes folder structure etc? 

I was using my iPhone 11 with a stylus and I did like it tbf - thanks for the help! I currently only use my iPad for Netflix especially since I was gifted a kindle 😂 I meant more of their planner or phone journal structure :) Kind of like people flipping through their planners or bullet journal.

And no problem! I'm guessing your iPad mini isn't compatible with apple pencil either?  If so, there are also some offbrand iPad styluses that might work with your iPad. There are also other good journaling apps, like Notability, that might be compatible with your current iPad model?"

My app has been updated to the latest version.i think the highlighter is made to go behind the text and not on top of it so as to keep it ""sharp"" looking. i guess. 

If your pdf is lighter in color you will see the color goes \_on top\_ of it tho (i draw on goodnotes and color the things in with highlighter, and when the outline is say, red, or orange, you can see the highlighter strokes on top of the linework) I’m an idiot- the color I wanted to use was really similar to the color of the paper so it looked like it was disappearing when it went behind the text, lol. Thank you for the info though! Im still having this issue...(see most recent post in this sub)

I tried changing to a lighter shade. Shading multiple times over the same area...nothing."

gh9m46,Goodnotes takes up a lot of storage,"Hello everyone,

I'm having problems with Goodnotes 5 on my iPad. For information: I work on the 11"" iPad Pro 2019 with 64 GB.

When I bought the iPad last year I thought that the storage should definitely be enough, since I'm saving my stuff mostly in clouds.

But I'm currently experiencing issues with the storage and I feel like they are caused by Goodnotes.

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space. 

I was happy and thought that the problem is solved.

But now I worked on my notes again for maybe 90 minutes and now Goodnotes takes up 10GB again.

I dont know what to do to solve this problem, so I hope maybe one of you can help me.

gwpt70,GoodNotes 5 PDF Problems When Visualized on Windows 10/Android?,"Has anyone else had problems with deleted dots when visualizing GoodNotes 5 PDF exports/auto-backups in Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 or Android phones? I'm currently using GoodNotes 5 (version 5.4.26, most recently) on my iPad Air 1, and I've noticed that visualizing GoodNotes PDF's in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge always ignores small dots (e.g. the dots in i's and j's, periods, colons). This occurs regardless of whether I visualize the PDF's in the browser directly or via a file sharing service like DropBox, and I've noticed this rendering issue on both my and my friend's Windows 10 laptops.

However, I do notice that the dots are properly included when I visualize the PDF's in Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader, or just directly on my iPad Air 1 (which are either more intensive PDF applications/which use Apple's PDF renderer). That means that the dots are there, just not visualized in Chrome/Edge. I know Google Chrome/Chromium's PDF engine doesn't implement the entire Adobe PDF specification, but has anyone else ran into this issue? Are there any solutions (or does GoodNotes 4 have this issue)?

As an example, I've included a link to one of my homework snapshots, which shows side-by-side comparisons of what I'm seeing on my iPad Air 1 and my Windows 10 laptop: [https://imgur.com/a/UggMdKt](https://imgur.com/a/UggMdKt).",,"[""Long as we see FF16 this month I don't care where it shows up."", 'At development services?

I'm currently using GoodNotes 5 (version 5.4.26, most recently) on my iPad Air 1, and I've noticed that visualizing GoodNotes PDF's in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge always ignores small dots (e.g. the dots in i's and j's, periods, colons). This occurs regardless of whether I visualize the PDF's in the browser directly or via a file sharing service like DropBox, and I've noticed this rendering issue on both my and my friend's Windows 10 laptops.

However, I do notice that the dots are properly included when I visualize the PDF's in Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader, or just directly on my iPad Air 1 (which are either more intensive PDF applications/which use Apple's PDF renderer). That means that the dots are there, just not visualized in Chrome/Edge. I know Google Chrome/Chromium's PDF engine doesn't implement the entire Adobe PDF specification, but has anyone else ran into this issue? Are there any solutions (or does GoodNotes 4 have this issue)?

As an example, I've included a link to one of my homework snapshots, which shows side-by-side comparisons of what I'm seeing on my iPad Air 1 and my Windows 10 laptop: [https://imgur.com/a/UggMdKt](https://imgur.com/a/UggMdKt).Long as we see FF16 this month I don't care where it shows up.

hnyyki,Goodnotes update 5.4.32,Yet another interesting update fix. Apparently this one deals with the autobackup feature sometimes requiring more disk space than necessary. I've been hearing about this problem for a while now when Goodnotes would cause disk space to suddenly fill up and people wondering about the autobackup feature. It's going to be interesting to see if this fix addresses the problem. The other fix has to do with the alignment of the paper templates in the vertical scrolling position. I'm wondering if this is related to an old problem I noted a long time ago about dark paper showing a thin white line on the right side.

So I am left Handed and have constant wrist pain, so I am always looking for something that will make me to things faster. I saw and old post here where someone built a custom Bluetooth Keyboard but me not being super useful with my hands I decided to look in the internet and see if I could find something that I liked and was functional.

Found those tiny Macropads where you can easily modify the keys with key combinations and that looked great. while navigating google images to see different models I found one with a Knob! a KNOB!! that is genius, sadly it seemed like it was a version that was out of stock navigated reddit to see if someone had a used one. Finally found a guy that made them, I asked him tons of questions such as if it would work with an ipad and was it hard to program etc.

He sent me videos and tutorials I said yeah why not. let's do it, I am not a techie person so setting up the whole thing so I could program the keyboard took me 2 hours, got the keypad today, flashed the file I did, it works like a charm. it is not fancy like the bluetooth one, but it uses USB C, and I just used a short one I had laying there (USB c to USB C)

We also have full custody of the kids so they live with me and rely on DH and me for EVERYTHING. BM only visits with them 3 times a year, at most. On one of her sporadic visits, I once texted SD to remind her of something and BM went off on DH via text saying that I didn\'t need to be texting the kids about things and if we needed something that he (DH) could contact her (BM). She ignores his messages even more than the kids do which is why we usually send reminders directly to the kids. I later learned from youngest SS that BM lost it and started yelling at the kids about me texting with them. She, once again, manipulated them into thinking that they hurt her simply by replying to me. She also checks their phones when they are with her so they feel the need to ""protect her feelings"" by pretending they always ignore me. I now completely understand why they don\'t respond to texts. SD still texts me for literally everything any other time of the year, but she goes ghost when with BM.

if9fnq,Goodnotes won't stop crashing,"I tried to import an image and suddenly, Goodnotes would not stop crashing. I could not keep it open for more than 1 second. I wasn't exactly sure if that import was the main issue but I suspect that it was... It might be a bug or not. I tried everything including updating the iOS but did not want to risk by deleting and re-installing the app because my iCloud was full and it did not have my latest notes backed up when it crashed. 

What I did to solve the crash issue was to go to settings and turn off almost all of the permissions. And when everything else failed, I also turned off the read and write permission of Photos.

I tried everything including updating the iOS but did not want to risk by deleting and re-installing the app because my iCloud was full and it did not have my latest notes backed up when it crashed. 

What I did to solve the crash issue was to go to settings and turn off almost all of the permissions. And when everything else failed, I also turned off the read and write permission of Photos.

j9hwji,Alignment and sizing help please,"Hello Darlings!

I am wondering if someone can help me.

I am making a sticker book in GoodNotes but i am having issues with making the stickers the same size and keeping them lined up properly.

Each sticker is an individual png and is pre cropped so that people can move them freely. 

So im not able to align them somewhere else and save a whole page of stickers because they need to remain independent.

So when i drag a png and drop them in  GoodNotes they end up different sizes. 
( Even though they were created the same size. )

This makes them all look disheveled no matter how i try to make it look nice.

Is there a way to make the stickers the same size in Goodnotes?

Is there an alignment tool so i know everything is straight?

I hope this makes sense.

jm8vz8,“Highlighter on top of text” issue respond from GoodNotes!,"A few days ago I wrote an email to GoodNotes about highlighter being on top of my texts and especially making the text underneath look dull. 
If you searched for an answer and couldn’t find one, here’s their respond: 

“I'm afraid the highlighting stroke has always been on top. If you use a highlighter color that's transparent, then it will take a huge number of strokes to eventually block the text it highlights, thus giving the appearance that the highlighting is behind the text. But if you try using a highlighter color that's more opaque, it will take just a few strokes to eventually cover the text. That means highlighting strokes are always on the top layer.

On dark paper, the general brightness of the paper is now detected and the strokes are adjusted accordingly to increase their visibility. Previously, if you drew or highlighted a white stroke on dark paper, the stroke would be almost invisible until you erased it and we got a large number of complaints about it. I realize this change isn't ideal, especially to users like you, and we'll think about introducing a ""behind-text"" highlighting mode so that more users can benefit.

Technically speaking for light papers, it blends with the text rather than behind the text. It just looks like ""behind the text"" for the blended effect.

They work in Goodnotes and Notability (I don’t use Notability because they lack organization like Goodnotes and Noteshelf). Just thought I’d post my thoughts on this planner. Anyway, have a nice holiday season and stay safe.THANK YOU!!! THEY BASICALLY COMBINED EVERYTHING INTO ONE PLANNER! And it’s 40% off too :) Lol sounds like a well planned ad. I just got advertised to lmao but I googled it and it is quite cute, I like the grid. But I wanna learn how to make my own planners!! Does anyone have great resources for this, particularly excellent YT videos and the like?"

l132c1,New thoughts on pen thickness settings.,I'm now of the opinion the size of the paper dictates the sizes of the pen thickness. Since most pdf journals being sold on Etsy use A4 templates writing with thick pen sizes will cause you to waste too much space to write simple sentences. I discovered the right size to use when using the zoom box is 0.45mm. However at regular style writing without the zoom box the right size to use from my point of view is still 1.2mm. The in between level is still 0.7mm. The only problem is when using the 0.45mm size is this causes writing to become too small to be legible. The only workaround is to either zoom onto the small text area or enlarge the text manually.,,['I personally always use 3 mm.

Life would be so much simpler if that were the case. \n\nFor example I have some huge triggers, and I expect people respect those when I’m around. If people are upset because they think my triggers have to do with them personally? Not my problem. My responsibility is to voice my needs and work with the people around me so we can all be comfortable. \n\nOP and the other person need to have a discussion on it and come to an agreement. OP shouldn’t have to suck it up, that’s how shit builds up and starts coming out in strange ways. Learning to discuss and navigate triggers in a productive manner is sadly a very essential part of life when you have trauma :/', 'Thanks, Karen.', 'It definitely made me hard']","Saw someone post a template like this and made a barebones version that works for me.

I recommend to use this style for subjects which deal with equations or molecule structures. For subjects with texts only, its not helpful.

They do this regularly every week, couple of weeks, or month. \n\nThat’s how they handle their internal business requests for features. They say “added to the list”, do some math, and then prioritize it. Usually that means it is put nowhere in range of any near-term work, and you are blown off.\n\nThis is a terrible way to interact with a customer because it is non-transparent, which violates the values of most software development, and it is misleading and deceitful. \n\nInstead, they should publish their plans for all new features for the coming year, let you know what those priorities are, who they are for, and why they are working on them. If you make a request, they should honestly answer “We have that on our list, but not this year and maybe not next” so you can grieve and go away.\n\nPeople will be refreshing the App Store every day wondering if their latest reddit post or tweet has their favorite feature in it. \n\nBut don’t feel too bad.

As many of you probably also do, I tend to experiment with a ton of different apps and templates. I always feel like things could be a bit better.

mgtz7q,More Customizable App,"Hello there,

I was just wondering, if i am alone with this wish.

I used to be a onenote user and really appreciated the amount of settings i can tweak to make the program look/work/feel exactly like i want it to. I got myself an 12.9 inch ipad pro and i am kinda disappointed by the lack of features of goodnotes.
Don't get me wrong, goodnotes works great and the feeling of writing with it is great imo, but still. I would like to have more colors via quick access, not just three, maybe some sort of better zoom feature, so i can set some presets for zooming in/out. Also the way the zoom-box works kinda disappointed me. I can't move it wherever i want, if i want it to be on the top of the page, i have to put the menu on the bottom? Why isn't the zoombox like ""a normal window"" which i can place wherever i want it to be? Or have it like splitscreen, when the ipad is horizontally on my desk?

I made the switch from Notability to GoodNotes about 6 months ago, and for the most part vastly prefer how it organizes notebooks. But a lot of my work involves importing and then marking up long PDFs, and Notability has a feature where you can view thumbnails of only the PDF pages that you've written notes on.  Super handy if you've got to type up your notes and there are only, say, 10 pages out of 100 you have thoughts on. Is there any way to accomplish a similar feat with GoodNotes? To see what pages of a PDF you've written on?

Thanks!Not that I know of, but you can add said pages to your favourites or to the outline for quick access."

It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it.

Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

ntud8l,"Just converted to GoodNotes from LiquidText, ?apparent problem already?","Hi there, I hope you're all doing well.

I've been a long time user of LiquidText (LT) but have had ongoing problems with shifting research papers in/out/between LT and various conventional file locations such as ""On my iPad"" and ""Dropbox"". I have literally hundreds of pdf files collected over many years. With that context...

I've purchased GoodNotes (GN) for my iPad and downloaded the MacPro app GN app, too. Based on comments in various places, it \_appeared\_ that GoodNotes could handle my big (number of individual) research papers use case. Both platforms are fully up-to-date with their respective OS updates.

I started by loading files beginning with the year ""2021"" within the GN app on my MacPro. (The filename doesn't matter, I assume, it's just a way of organizing in the creaky old file system approach to file mgmt.) I saw the files appear in my iPad instance of GN. Yay! Then I decided to create folders named ""2021"", ""2020"", etc. I did this on my MacPro. I have yet to see those folder names appear on my iPad. I still see the original load of files names beginning with ""2021"" on my iPad. I see the folders with year names on my MacPro instance of GN. I've successfully moved the initially bulk loaded files into the ""2021"" subfolder and bulk loaded appropriate files into the sub-year folders on the MacPro from where they were located on DropBox.

I have yet to see anything different than the initially loaded files (via MacPro GN) on my iPad GN. I've closed the GN apps on both MacPro and iPad. Still no change on the iPad GN Documents view. I've tried examining every visible option on the iPad GN screen. I don't see a &lt;- (back arrow) to go ""up"" a level on the iPad GN Document screen. I don't see the folders I created within the MacPro GN app in the iPad GN app.

Any ideas? This morning was the iPadOS 14.6 update. Could there be a bug created in GN by that update? Anyone else see this problem?

o82agv,Annoying zoom popup (not Auto Advance),"This has been annoying me for almost as long as I have used GoodNotes (a minor complaint but I would absolutely love to find a way to get rid of it).

I have the palm rejection on both low and high and it still happens regardless of the setting.

When my hand touches the screen of my iPad, it will pop up with this little bubble. If I tap it, it will zoom in. If I don't, it will go away or move to another part of the screen. Sometimes it will make my pencil lag, so it will miss a letter.

Not that those games aren't still great, but it would have been more natural for Kiryu to have passed the torch YEARS ago, instead of always being dragged back into the plot. Yeah the series has had other shared protagonists which is a good thing, but Kiryu being there just steals the spotlight from what should be the next Generation, to the point they needed to make Yakuza 6 entirely about just Kiryu again, to FINALLY move on from this character.

You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.\n\n*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that elicit the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from habituating. Therefore, avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain novel, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Moreover, avoidance tends to generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*\n\nIf your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly carefully expose yourself to situations that you know give you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print.
