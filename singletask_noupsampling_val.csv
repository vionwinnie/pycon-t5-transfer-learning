tag classification,"Goodnotes vs Notability vs NoteshelfI‚Äôm a first year pre nursing student and decided I wanted to go paperless to see how I liked it. I recently bought a MacBook and iPad Pro to help with my studies. Because of COVID my classes are online however, once it‚Äôs over I‚Äôll return to in person. I‚Äôve been watching a lot of reviews on YouTube but still can‚Äôt decide between these apps. I really don‚Äôt want to have to use 2 apps because I‚Äôd feel less organize. Some of the features I want are:

‚Ä¢ the ability to import slides and annotate them ( preferably with the three lines at the side) 
‚Ä¢ the majority of my books are ebooks so I‚Äôd like to be able to annotate those as well
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm taking a lot of science classes so I‚Äôd want to draw diagrams and trace pictures 
‚Ä¢ user friendlyI both have Notability and Goodnotes, so I can answer for them.

Notability: NTs ink flow and shape tools superior to GNs. I find NTs filing system much more useful than GNs (especially better if you take a lot of notes). This application much more suited for class notes and quick notes. Most of the users (especially in r/notabilityapp) having problems with the developer team's lack of consistent updates.

Goodnotes: You have to take your time to make your handwriting pretty. However, your end product looks really good. Highlighting tool is still superior. Shortcuts like different pen colors, auto-deselect eraser and quick access to photos makes whole writing experience much more fluid. 

Overall, I think both apps works great if it is suited to your study and note taking aims. None of the apps currently has hyperlinking option. You can check out other typed note apps like r/RoamResearch for that. One thing about working with PDF slides that [if you have LaTeX knowledge you can use this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/notabilityapp/comments/fx1ota/importing_pdfs_eg_slides_from_a_powerpoint_or/) Otherwise, both apps works pretty well with any presentation file.",Question

tag classification,"How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?I'm a PhD student and have imported 10-15 books, 70 (so far) articles and book chapters, several notebooks for notetaking (about 100 pages each), probably 30 annotated PDF lectures on my iPad. Once I import any PDF into Goodnotes, the app saves it in the .goodnotes format. And I save and backup all files in the Goodnotes format.  I only export my notes to PDF for storage on Dropbox once I'm satisfied that doc needs no further edits.  Using this method, I'm at 8GB of storage.  However, if Goodnotes adds audio recordings (I can only dream), then I can imagine my library size swelling.

I was kidding myself when I said I would use only Goodnotes on the Ipad.  It turns out Dropbox (for backing up), Procreate (to aid with diagrams) and the Iphoto library (where my screenshots from lecture material or internet go), Notability, and Anki take up another 30 gigs easily.  

I've never experienced a lag on the ipad (except when certain PDF books were graphics intense).  Keep it organised from the start and the incremental backups, won't take long. You've already invested so much in law school already, just spend a few more hundred and never have to worry about this again.  Good luck So helpful, thanks so much! Some of the textbooks are really long (1k pages) but those ones aren't graphics heavy, just fat slabs of text, and then all my anatomy textbooks are full of pictures and diagrams but I only use one per semester so I'll be able to move the ones I don't need off the device if need be. I think it'll end up being okay. And my slide decks are provided by the University in .pdf format so that's really good! I'm glad the iPad doesn't lag too much once it's full Thank you so much for this, I hadn't even considered that GN goes though iCloud.. I had an old apple ID when I was quite a bit younger and iCloud's free 15GB filled up so quickly with just photos. And yes I did want my iPad and MBA to talk to each other the same way OneNote syncs across all my devices. I think I would have run into the full cloud storage issue much quicker with OneNote but my institution gives 1TB storage to all students and that's why I haven't noticed things filling up.

This whole scene is just... golden. 95% of diets fail. Ask anyone who has dieted if losing weight is easy. Look on the bright side, in a couple of years RTX 3080s will be cheap and plentiful.   Compared to the past, there are relatively few mid and low range cards being made. Overall number of cards made though is higher than ever. That will put a huge downward pressure on prices for the 3080 and 3090 once supply sorts itself out and new cards are launched.  That will be further exacerbated should RTX 30 series cards become unprofitable for mining (due to ASICS or a drop in crypto prices)

Note that we already saw a similar series of events (at smaller scale) with the 10 series cards. Those were scalped and horded by miners at launch and were dumped in 2018-2019 (2-3 yrs after launch.  I got my 1070 for under $150 on eBay in late 2019.

I'd pick Romans since I've heard Gladiators were not killed or fought to the death, and more like professional athletes, and when they are hurt or wounded badly, it would be a big letdown for the crowd. You're treated like a celebrity outside the arena and you could be used to sponsor people's products. You are fed very well, have proper medical attention when badly hurt, and who wouldn't want to know how to fight. [removed] Upvoted!",Question
tag classification,"A document keeps opening by itself each time I open Goodnotes?As per the video, the document Assignment6 keeps opening up by itself each time I close it after a restart of the GoodNotes app.

When the document Assignment6 is the only document open and I restart GoodNotes, it will reset the whole app and get rid of all the open documents I have.

I tried restarting my iPad as well but the issue still persists. Anyone else experiencing the same thing? what happens if you try to save the file on files app, then deleting the active copy on goodnotes (the one causing trouble) and then importing the file again? Just tried - same thing...",Question
tag classification,"[HELP] Note taking: I cannot get used to itI just bought a Galaxy Tab A 8"" with S-PEN, and I want to take my notes using it. However, I feel that my hand starts to suffer after using the pen for some minutes. I feel my shoulders are stressed and pressed. Do you have any tips to begin having a better experience?Same question here :) Write like you normally would on a piece of paper When I used my SPEN before I got my IPad, I found it very uncomfortable as well, but when I got my iPad, my issue seemed to go away, maybe it‚Äôs the shape or something.

tag classification,"How do I get hyperlinks to work in GoodNotes 5?I switched over from Notify because I like what I saw from GoodNotes 5  feature set though it does seem more complicated. I just want to be able to collect and launch hyperlinks when I need them directly from my IPad  using the app and it doesn‚Äôt work.Yeah it doesn‚Äôt have this feature. The only hyperlinks are from imported PDFs which is where you see all the planner apps etc incorporating them so they can click on a tab and go to that page.   
At the moment, you can‚Äôt click on any URL text, it is simply text. I‚Äôm hoping they include it in an upcoming feature that they‚Äôre hinting about on beta. 

The way I‚Äôve been getting around it is to use an ‚Äòopen in safari‚Äô shortcut from the shortcuts app. It‚Äôs clunky though, you have to select the text tool, then manually select the text then share button and invoke the shortcut that way. It‚Äôs crazy that it doesn‚Äôt have such a basic feature. Agreed, and there seem to be requests for these types of basic features (including hyperlinks) going back *years*. Wild.",Question

He followed science and people want to blame him instead of trump and his batshit quackery. This is a very standard opinion Thanks for the heads up. It is a concern because I'll probably be moving this year. I guess I better have at least a months living expenses saved up just in case.

tag classification,"GoodNotes 5 keeps crashing on iPad 6th gen when I zoom inAm I the only one with this problem? I know 6th gen iPad is not the best at running more than one app at a time but using GoodNotes alone has been fine for me up till now. My iPad OS is updated, GoodNotes is also updated so is this an app problem or my device is just too slow/old for GoodNotes?I‚Äôm using the same iPad as you, with no issues. Issues can come from a variety of reasons, like the templates used (for example, some that are created by users might be large file sizes), bugs, how much space is available, the trash can in GoodNotes, etc. I would recommend going through the usual troubleshooting, like looking for updates, emptying the trash can, deleting and reinstalling GoodNotes and contacting support ‚ò∫Ô∏è Ohhh must‚Äôve been the digital journal I was using then!
